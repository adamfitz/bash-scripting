# bash-scripting
Some basic shell scripts I sometimes find useful

- subnetCheck.sh - do a reverse lookup on all Ipv4 addresses in a /24 netblock

- tap_interfaces_gns3.sh - create multiple tap interfaces and add them to a bridge to connect devices in gns3 to local network

- install_frr_deb8.sh - script to install and configure frrouting (from git repo) on debian 8

- ansible_install_ubuntu.sh - installs ansible from Ubuntu PPA (works with ubuntu/debian)
